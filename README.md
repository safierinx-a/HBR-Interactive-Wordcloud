# HBR-Interactive-Wordcloud
Interactive wordcloud made from text extracted from Harvard Business Review articles from the years 2018-2019.  

The text was scraped using beautifulSoup in Python and processed into a dataframe listing each word, its frequency, and a corpus made from every single line containing the word in the articles.

The wordcloud was made using the WordCloud2 library in R and implemented in Shiny Apps.
